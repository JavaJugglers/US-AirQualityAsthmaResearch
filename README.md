## Introduction

This repository hosts the research project titled "Assessing the effects of particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations on asthma prevalence: Data science evidence from the United States." This interdisciplinary study combines environmental science, public health, and data analytics to explore the relationship between air pollution and asthma prevalence in the United States.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains all datasets used in this study, including daily PM2.5 and ozone concentration data and US chronic disease indicators for asthma.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and generating visualizations.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing the exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and findings.
- `docs/`: Documentation including data source descriptions, methodology, and additional research notes.
- `results/`: Contains all output from the analyses, including tables and figures.

## Data Overview

Datasets include daily PM2.5 and ozone concentrations from 2011-2014 and US Chronic Disease Indicators related to asthma. These datasets, primarily from the CDC, offer a comprehensive view of environmental factors and health outcomes.

### Key Aspects:
- Granular data on PM2.5 and ozone concentrations.
- Yearly estimates of asthma prevalence.
- Data preprocessing for compatibility and analysis efficiency.
- Consideration of population representation and privacy issues.

## Research Questions

1. **Impact of Air Pollution on Asthma Risk**: Explores the correlation between air pollution (PM2.5 and Ozone) and asthma prevalence.
2. **Causal Effect of PM2.5 on Asthma**: Investigates the causal relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and asthma prevalence using propensity score matching.

## Methodology

- **Multiple Hypothesis Testing**: Used for analyzing the relationship between air pollutants and asthma prevalence.
- **Causal Inference (Propensity Score Matching)**: To study the causal effect of PM2.5 concentrations on asthma prevalence.
- **Data Processing Techniques**: Preprocessing large datasets, handling confounding factors, and ensuring data integrity.

## Results and Discussion

The study finds varying levels of association between air pollutants and asthma prevalence. The results are carefully interpreted, considering the limitations of observational data and the methodologies employed.

### Key Highlights:
- Application of Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg corrections.
- Insights into the relationship between air pollution and asthma.
- Discussion on the limitations and potential improvements for future research.

## Conclusion

The research provides valuable insights into the relationship between air pollution and asthma prevalence, although the findings are constrained by data limitations and the complexity of environmental health interactions. Further research is recommended to deepen the understanding of these relationships.
